# RIA-Tools

More to come... Do

```bash
riatools help
```

for basic help. Main subcommands currently are `archive` for creating the 7z archives and `gc` for garbage collection.

All shell scripts were originally written in the upstream repo [`datalad/ria-tools`](https://github.com/datalad/ria-tools) but the cli has been significantly altered here.


## Installation

Easiest through pipx:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/pvandyken/ria-tools.git
```
